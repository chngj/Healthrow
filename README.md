## Insights Summary 

**For campaign evaluation performance, we focused on these north star metrics:**
- **Signup Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and sign up for a Row Health Plan.
- **Cost per Signup:** The average dollars spent to acquire a signup from each campaign.
- **Click Through Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.

#### Signup Rate
- Across campaign categories, Health for All had the best performing signup rate (2.08%). They also had the second highest number of signups (3.5k).
- #Healthyliving had 3.7K signups but fell through with their signup rate at a low of 0.27%.
- Health for All is an outlier in its campaign type of Health Awareness. The second highest performing campaign type only has a 0.02% signup rate.

#### Click through Rate:
- Health for All had the highest CTR at 25.48% and Benefits update 22.17%. Health for All noticeably has the lowest amount of impressions at 170K.
- Golden Years Security had the lowest CTR at 1.41%. An investigation should be done to see why CTR rate is so low when impressions are not considerably low.
- Family Coverage Plan does not contain any CTR data or Cost per Click data, investigate to see if there is missing data or issues with data collection.

#### Cost per Signup
- Golden Year Security in addition to a low CTR also has a high cost per signup as a result. The cps is $176.73 while the average is $29.04. An investigation should be conducted into Golden Year Security to either discontinue or cut costs.
- Coverage matters has the lowest cost per sign up at $0.65. A key note is that CTR is only at 10.43% so this campaign has very high retention once customers click and learn about the campaign.
